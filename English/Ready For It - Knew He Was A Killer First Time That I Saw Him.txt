Knew He Was A Killer First Time That I Saw Him,Wonder How
Many Girls He Had Loved And Left Haunted..But If He's A Ghost, Then
I Can Be A Phantom,Holdin' Him For Ransom..Some, Some
Boys Are Tryin' Too Hard,He Don't Try At All,Though Younger Than My
Exes But He Act Like Such A Man So.I See Nothing Better,I Keep
Him Forever,..Like A Vendetta-Ta,I-I-
I See How This Is Gon' Go.. Touch Me
And You'll Never Be Alones

You're The Light, You're The Night,You're The Color Of My
Blood,You're The Cure,You're The Pain,You're
The Only Thing I Wanna Touch..
Never Knew That It Could Mean So Much,
So Much, You're The
Fear,..I Don't Care..'Cause  I've Never Been So
High,Follow Me To The Dark..Let Me Take You
Past Our Satellites

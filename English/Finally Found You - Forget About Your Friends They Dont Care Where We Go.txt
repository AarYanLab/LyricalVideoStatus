Forget About Your Friends They Don't Care Where We Go..If
They Do, We'll Get Lost In A Crowd Of People,I've Been
Looking For You Forever Baby We Go..Together Baby
We Go, We Go,In This Crazy World Of Choices
I've Only Got A Few..Either You're Coming With Me,Or
I'm Coming With You..'Cause I  Finally Found,
I Finally Found
You...

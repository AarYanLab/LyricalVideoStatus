We're All Bored,We're All So Tired Of Everything,
We Wait For Trains That Just Aren't Coming,
We Show Off,Our Different Scarlet Letters,Trust Me,
Mine Is Better...We're So
Young,But We're On The Road To Ruin,We Play
Dumb..But We Know Exactly What We're Doing,We Cry
Tears,Of Mascara In The Bathroom,Honey, Life Is
Just A Classroom

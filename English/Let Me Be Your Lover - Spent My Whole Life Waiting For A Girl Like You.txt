Spent My Whole Life Waiting For A Girl Like You..
Baby Tell Me What I Got To Do..
We Can Leave This Party, Back To My Room..
You Could Show Me A Thing Or Two..'Cause I
Been Spending All My Money,On These Pretty Girls And Alcohol,
But Honey They Ain't Got A Thing On You,
You Shook Me Once,You Shook Me Twice,Now Take Me To Your
Paradise
